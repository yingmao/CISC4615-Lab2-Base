### CISC 4615 Lab 2 base code

In the Lab 1, we learned how to programming with sockets and TCP. In the lab 2, we will
UPD as our protocol and integrate CRC into the tranmissions.Different from TCP, UDP is a connection less protocol. There is no connection is established between client and server.

#### UDP Protocol Workflow

In UDP, the client does not form a connection with the server like in TCP and instead, it just
sends a datagram. Similarly, the server need not to accept a connection and just waits for
datagrams to arrive. We can call a function called connect() in UDP but it does not result
anything like it does in TCP. There is no 3 way handshake(we will study this topic later). It
just checks for any immediate errors and store the peerâ€™s IP address and port number. connect()
is storing peers address so no need to pass server address and server address length arguments
in sendto().

#### CRC Generator and Checker

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error detection mechanism in which a special number
is appended to a block of data in order to detect any changes introduced during storage (or
transmission).
Transmitted messages are divided into predetermined lengths that are divided by a fixed divisor. According to the calculation, the remainder number is appended onto and sent with the
message. When the message is received, the receiver recalculates the remainder and compares it to the
transmitted remainder. If the numbers do not match, an error is detected.

#### Study the sample code

Please study the sample code to understand the code style and logic of the samples. The samples are written in both CPP and Python2.7.

- Sample 1: Client sends a message to server by using UDP protocol. Client will break out of the loop by typing `bye`.
- Sample 2: User inputs a message, the program will calculate the CRC32 code for this message.
- Sample 3: client accepts a message from the users, and calculates a CRC32 code for this messgae. Then, it sends the message along with the CRC32 code to the server.

After compiling the samples (c++), you can run the samples as shown below (using python2.7)

- Sample 1:
	- CPP: ./server 9000(port number) and ./client 127.0.0.1 9000(port number)
	- Python: python2.7 client.py 127.0.0.1 9000 and python server.py 9000

- Sample 2: 
	- CPP: ./crc
	- Python: python2.7 crc.py
- Sample 3:
	- CPP: ./server 9000(port number) and ./client 127.0.0.1 9000(port number)
	- Python: python2.7 client.py 127.0.0.1 9000 and python server.py 9000
 
 

`Update: I have uploaded a python 3 version.`

### Lab 2 Part 2 Workflow

1. A send the message along with the corresponding CRC to B. Based on sample 3, the client sends a message_1 with the CRC_1 to the server. Therefore, you do not need to change anything and use the client code of sample 3 to be your program A.

2. (Based on server code of sample 3) When B receives the message_1 with CRC _1, we will need to decide whether it needs to change the message_1 or not.

    2.1 B follows a 40% probability to change the message_1. There are multiple methods to construct a 40% event. For example, you can generate a random from 0 - 100, and change the message _1 if the number is less 40.

    2.2 Please note that you only need to change message_1, not CRC_1. To change a message, you can just add a letter to it.

   2.3 B forwards the message_2 (may or may not be the same as message_1 depends on the 40% probability) along with CRC_1 to C.

3. (Based on server code of sample 3) When C receives a package that consists of message_2 and CRC_1, it needs to decide whether message_2 is the original one that sent by A. 

   3.1 C will need to extract the message_2 and CRC_1 from the package. You can use the same code as the server in sample 3.

   3.2 C will need to generate a CRC_2 based on message_1. How to generate it? Please check out the client code in sample 3.

   3.3  C will need to compare CRC_2 with CRC_1 and depends on the result of the comparison, you need the print out the conclusion of whether the message is original or not.
